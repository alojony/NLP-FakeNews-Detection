# Fake News Detection

Welcome to our NLP project repository, where we tackle the pressing issue of fake news detection using advanced machine learning techniques. Our project aims to automatically preprocess textual data, validate the authenticity of news articles, classify their topics, and analyze the evolution of news stories over time.

## Introduction

This section should provide an overview of your project. Explain the problem of fake news, its impact, and how your project addresses this challenge using NLP.
Features

Key features of the project:

- Automated preprocessing of news articles
- Validation of news authenticity
- Topic classification of news articles
- Regression analysis on the evolution of news stories
